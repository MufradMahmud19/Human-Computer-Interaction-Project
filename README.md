# Human-Computer-Interaction-Project

Description:
This project focuses on building a prototype of a user-centered application designed to enhance user engagement through features like wishlist submission, upvoting, and categorized navigation. The project emphasizes intuitive design, ease of use, and culturally relevant product recommendations. I gave it a name, Wishly Online Shopping.

Key Features:
  Wishlist Functionality: Users can submit and upvote specific item demands.
  Categorized Navigation: Structured product organization for better accessibility.
  Admin Controls: User-friendly tools to filter and manage product visibility.

Paper Prototyping:
  The project began with low-fidelity paper prototyping to establish the basic structure and functionality of the application. Paper prototyping allowed for quick ideation, testing, and iteration of core features before moving to digital design. This step provided valuable insights into user navigation flow and interface expectations, ensuring a smoother transition to the high-fidelity version.

Challenges & Learnings:
  The project highlighted areas for improvement, such as simplifying the signup process, enhancing sorting methods, and ensuring interface intuitiveness. It reinforced the importance of usability testing and iterative design to meet user expectations effectively.

Figma Prototyping:
  The high-fidelity prototype was designed and refined using Figma, a powerful interface design tool. Figma enabled seamless collaboration, version control, and interactive prototyping. Key user flows, such as navigation between pages, wishlist interactions, and admin controls, were simulated to provide a near-realistic experience for usability testing. The tool's flexibility allowed for quick iterations based on user feedback, ensuring the final prototype met user expectations.

Evaluation Methods:
  Think-Aloud Sessions: Collected qualitative user feedback for design and functionality.
  Co-operative Evaluation: Assessed visual appeal, interaction smoothness, and logical structure.

This project illustrates the potential of the application and lays the groundwork for further development to improve usability and user satisfaction.
